** Pre-requisite: C programming

* Notes on Parallel Programming using pthreads, openMP and open MPI.


** open MPI concepts:
   - MPI is a library for message passing or communication between nodes/cores to perform parallel programming in Distributed Memory Architecture
   - Distributed Memory Architecture vs Shared Memory Architecture
   - What is a process?
   - MPI_Initialize, MPI_Finalize
   - What is rank?
   - What is size?
   - Communicator: 
     - MPI_COMM_WORLD
